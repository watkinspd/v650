caption: The Versys 650 started in 2007, was updated in 2010, again in 2014 and recently in 2018. It's a long running model line, sold aroud the world.<br>It has 60hp which means it is a full size motorcycle - it is not underpowered like many 250-500cc bikes would be. At the same time, you can actually use this bike's full power in daily driving - it has enough performance to be "more than fun" and has great agility and handling for our fabulous motorcycling roads here on the island.<br>Bonus - it's a 650 so its in the mid-price insurance bracket.
