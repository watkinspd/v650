caption: Most of the accessories are detached in this view.<br>This is a great motorcycle.<br>It's agile, quick, can be ridden sporty, or commute to work, or go on road trips.<br>Motorcycle magazine reviews and videos rate the bike well in its class against its competition.<br>Kawasaki uses this engine and driveline in the Ninja 650, ER6n, Versys 650, and Vulcan S. It has been produced, largely unchanged, for many years. A huge plus when it comes to parts, maintenance, repair etc.
